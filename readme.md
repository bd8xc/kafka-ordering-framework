# 🍔 Kafka Ordering Framework

Welcome to the **Kafka Ordering Framework** — a simulation of a real-time food ordering system built using **Apache Kafka**, **ClickHouse**, and **Python**. This project demonstrates how modern streaming systems can be used to manage and analyze takeaway food orders at scale.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This system emulates the flow of food orders through various microservices:

* A **Kafka Producer** generates grouped orders.
* A **Consumer Service** processes them in real-time.
* A **Transaction Service** confirms them.
* A **ClickHouse Database** stores and powers fast analytics.
* An **Analytics Module** visualizes order trends and business insights.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bd8xc/kafka-ordering-framework.git
cd kafka_order_system
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure your Python environment is activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### 3. Start Kafka & Zookeeper

Navigate to your Kafka installation directory and run:

```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

### 4. Run Producer

```bash
python producer/grouped_order_producer.py
```

### 5. Run Consumer and Transaction Logic

```bash
python services/order_consumer.py
python services/transaction.py
```

### 6. Run Analytics

```bash
python services/analytics.py
```
